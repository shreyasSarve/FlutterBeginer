# **Flutter & API 's**
 In this project I tried working with apis as name suggest :smiley: worked on 
 - Fetching Data
 - Fetching Particular Node
 - Pushing Data
 - Modifying Data
 - Deleting Data
 
For this I used [Swagger UI](https://tq-notes-api-jkrgrdggbq-el.a.run.app/swagger/index.html)   <-- very simple and very easy to use has every basic method that we learn during Rest API 

## App Interface
